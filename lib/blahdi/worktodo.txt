somehow tie back to dependency model
JS?

vm.status (include host name)
vm.nic.attach (update to port-group / ls)
vm.nic.detach (update to port-group / ls)
host.vm.list
cluster.vm.list

logical-switches.list <name>
context.resolve <tab?>
- list resolveable entities?
- resolve up / down?
- tree cmd to display output to terminal?
